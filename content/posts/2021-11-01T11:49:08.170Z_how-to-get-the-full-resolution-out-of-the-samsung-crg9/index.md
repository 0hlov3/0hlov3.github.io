Hi there,

After a long search for a way to run two widescreen monitors with my MacBook Pro, I finally found a setup that works. 
I struggled to figure it out using online guides, so I ended up buying several USB-C to HDMI adapters that didn’t solve 
the problem. Eventually, I discovered that a USB-C to DisplayPort adapter was the key.

Here’s my current setup:
1. I ordered the KabelDirekt USB-C to DisplayPort Adapter from Amazon and connected it to my Samsung CRG9 monitor. This allows the Samsung to run at its full resolution of 5,120 x 1,440 pixels, and it even supports HDR.
2. For my second monitor, an LG Ultrawide, I used the UGREEN USB-C Hub, which enables it to run at its full resolution of 3,440 x 1,440 pixels.

This setup has been a game changer for me, and I’m very happy with the results.

As of January 25, 2025, I’ve also upgraded my cable for even better compatibility and support for full resolution. 
I’m now using the UGREEN USB-C to DisplayPort 1.4 Cable, which supports up to 8K at 60Hz, 4K at 240Hz, HDR, and VRR.
