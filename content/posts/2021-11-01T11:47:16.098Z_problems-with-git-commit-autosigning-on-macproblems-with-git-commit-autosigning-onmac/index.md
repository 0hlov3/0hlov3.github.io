If you've enabled GPG signing for Git commits on macOS, you might occasionally encounter this frustrating error message:

```plaintext
❯ git commit -m 'Test'
error: gpg failed to sign the data
fatal: failed to write commit object
```

This happens when the GPG agent gets stuck or isn't properly configured. Here's how to fix it.

## Quik fix

If you need a quick solution, you can restart the GPG agent using the following command:

```plaintext
pkill -9 gpg-agent && export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
```

This will kill the stuck GPG agent process and set the `GPG_TTY` environment variable to the current terminal. 
After running this command, retry your Git operation.

## Permanent Fix

To avoid encountering this issue repeatedly, you can configure your shell to automatically set the `GPG_TTY` environment variable.
Follow these steps:

1. Open your shell configuration file. This could be `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`, depending on your shell.
2. Add the following lines:
   ```plaintext
   GPG_TTY=$(tty)
   export GPG_TTY
   ```
3. Save the file and reload your shell configuration. You can do this by running:
   ```shell
   source ~/.bashrc  # Replace with your shell configuration file
   ```

These steps ensure that the GPG agent always knows the correct terminal to use, preventing the error from occurring.

## Bonus Tips

1. Ensure GPG is Properly Installed and Updated, use Homebrew to install or update GPG on macOS:
   ```bash
   brew install gpg
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   brew upgrade gpg
   ```
2. Check Your Git Configuration, verify that your Git is configured to use GPG for signing:
   ```shell
   git config --global user.signingkey <your-gpg-key-id>
   git config --global commit.gpgsign true
   ```
3. Debugging GPG Issues, if you still face problems, increase GPG’s verbosity to diagnose the issue:
   ```bash
   gpg --list-keys
   GPG_TTY=$(tty) gpg --sign testfile.txt
   ```

With these steps, your GPG signing experience on macOS should be smooth and error-free. Happy coding!
