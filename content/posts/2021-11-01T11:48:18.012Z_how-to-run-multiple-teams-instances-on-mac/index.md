Today we take a look at a solution, how to open 2 teams instances on the Mac simultaneously. I have been looking for a solution that would allow me to do this for a long time, because I have to be active in 2 teams in 2 instances for professional reasons.

So itâ€™s that simple, we installed the native teams app and use it as our first instance, if we want to run a second teams app, we can simply install the Microsoft Edge Browser from the APP store and go to [https://teams.microsoft.com/](https://teams.microsoft.com/), there we can install the browser plugin for teams and run our second instance via the browser.
