Hi there,

i’ve been looking for a long time for a solution to run 2 widescreen monitors with my Macbook Pro, but i couldn’t figure it out from the net, so i bought tons of USB-C to HDMI adapters, until i found a USB-C to DisplayPort adapter to do the conversion.

I ordered the “KabelDirekt — USB C to DisplayPort DP “ adapter from Amazon, I connected it to my Samsung CRG9, so my Samsung monitor now runs with the desired resolution of 5,120 x 1,440 pixels, furthermore I connected an LG Ultrawide monitor with the “UGREEN USB C Hub” to my MacBook Pro, so it runs with the full resolution of 3440 x 1440 pixels.

I am now very happy with this solution, furthermore the Samsung even supports HDR.
